# Development Environment

:::caution

🚨 Only Yarn v3 is supported - npm, pnpm, yarn v1... will not work, this is due to JupyterLab requirements.

:::

Choose the way you want to develop Jupyter UI:

1. [With Conda](/docs/develop/dev-environment/conda)
1. [With VS Code Devcontainers](/docs/develop/dev-environment/devcontainers)

Once you have applied the steps described in one of the above 2 options, you are ready to develop following the next steps.

```bash
# Install the dependencies. This will take some time, be patient. 👍
yarn install
```

```bash
# Build the source code. This will also take some time, be also patient. 🙂
yarn build
```

If you just want to develop the core package `@datalayer/jupyter-react` of the repository, go to the sub folder and work there.

```bash
cd packages/react
yarn build
```
