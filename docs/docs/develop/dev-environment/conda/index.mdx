# Setup with a Conda environment

Follow the below steps to use and develop Jupyter UI.

You need [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) up-and-running on your machine.

:::caution

`macOS` or `Linux` are supported out-of-the-box. If you run on `Windows`, [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) is required and your will need to run the commands from a Cygwin shell.

:::

Clone the `jupyter-ui` repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui.git && \
  cd jupyter-ui
```

If you already have created a conda environment named `datalayer`, please remove it.

```bash
conda deactivate
conda remove -y --all -n datalayer
```

Create a new conda environment and activate it.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate datalayer
```
