# Pyodide

As Jupyter React ships with the in-browser Python kernel [Pyodide](https://github.com/jupyterlite/pyodide-kernel), packaging
your code is not trivial.

We recommend using [Webpack](/docs/integrations/webpack) as bundler for your project. Then you will need to
add the following rules to support in-browser kernels:

```json
  "module": {
    "rules": [
      /*
       ... the rules for the JavaScript and CSS assets
      */
      // Rule for the JupyterLite service worker.
      // !important this must result in a file named `service-worker.js`
      // to be served at the root of your website.
      {
        resourceQuery: /text/,
        type: 'asset/resource',
        generator: {
          filename: '[name][ext]',
        },
      },
      // Rule for pyodide kernel
      {
        test: /pypi\/.*/,
        type: 'asset/resource',
        generator: {
          filename: 'pypi/[name][ext][query]',
        },
      },
      {
        test: /pyodide-kernel-extension\/schema\/.*/,
        type: 'asset/resource',
        generator: {
          filename: 'schema/[name][ext][query]',
        },
      }
    ]
  }
```
